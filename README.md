# Passphrase Keeper

## Trustless application for saving non-custodial wallet passphrases such as Trzeor, Ledger and others
*Characteristics:*

- Resistant to brute force attacks
- Anti keylogger
- Security is in the algorithms and not in the device (inviolable)
- Cold storage

## Are Trezor and Ledger safe?

According to the most modern security concepts, the total security of a device is reduced to the largest flaw; in the case of the most well-known hardware wallets, it is not true, as advertised, that the private key never leaves the device, but leaves it at the moment in which it is written on a piece of paper, this makes events such as:
The cleaning lady finds the passphrase (the 24 words) in a piece of paper hidden between the pages of a book, so this is the security level of this hardware device!
This is the biggest flaw and this is therefore the maximum security level of your wallet.

## Trezor and Ledger bug fix

This project allows you to keep your passphrase in cold storage that cannot be hacked in any way:
We took our idea from the concept of security introduced by Bitcoin technology: Security does not have to be intrinsic in the hardware or in making things inaccessible, but it must be in the algorithm! In contrast to secure backup systems at the hardware level (systems based on trust in the hardware), we have developed a secure save system at the algorithm level (trustless), whose code is open source and inspectable.
What does this mean, if the passphrase saved with our software falls into the hands of hackers or malicious people, it cannot under any circumstances be deciphered, neither with attacks on the encryption algorithms, nor even with a brute force attack!

## Cold passphrase storage
We have created a stand alone version:
A cold storage based on a pen drive bootable system (isolated from the internet), this device will be marketed to finance the project.
We would like to point out that the security of the device is based on algorithms, and working cold is simply additional security:
Any physical or internet theft does not allow the passphrase to be restored!

## FAQ

 * How the passphrase is saved?
  * The passphrase is not saved: The seed you type when you start the device starts a series of recursive hashes (5 million), the fact that they are recursive operations means that parallelism is not very useful for brute force attacks: Recursion causes so that each hashing operation must wait for the previous result in order to make parallelism useless in brute force attacks. This operation is started simultaneously on eight threads, with a seed derived from the typed seed that is different for each thread, at the end the result of each thread is combined to give a unique result, this result is the 32 byte password that will allow you to encrypt and regenerate passphrase on restore.
    These recursive operations to generate the password take a long time even on powerful computers and cannot be accelerated (due to recursion), and this is the key to resistance to brute force attacks: It would take millions of years!
    In the restore operation, the same recursive hashing operation is performed to regain the password (32 bytes) starting from a typed seed, this means that any typed seed still generates a password which in turn will restore a passphrase, but only the correct seed generates the correct passphrase.
    At a cryptographic level, the passphrase is transformed into a sequence of bytes composed of 11 bits for each word (the minimum necessary), and is compiled with an XOR with the password generated by the recursive hashing operation, so that each bit is changed in a completely random, and this is the data that is saved.
    Upon recovery, any seed typed can restore any passphrase sequence, there is no CRC to indicate which one the user typed, but only the correct seed regenerates the correct passphrase. In addition to this, each application creates a 32-bit entropy which will be different for each device, this entropy is used to encrypt the seed before subjecting it to recursive hashing, this means that it is not possible to carry out a brute force attack in a preventive starting from frequently used words such as seed by doing a recursive pre-hashing of all the most used ones, as each application/device has a different entropy of 32 bytes, making generalized pre-calculations useless.
