# Passphrase Keeper

## Trustless application for saving non-custodial wallet passphrases such as Trzeor, Ledger and others
*Characteristics:*

- Resistant to brute force attacks
- Anti keylogger
- Security is in the algorithms and not in the device (inviolable)
- Cold storage

## Are Trezor and Ledger safe?

According to the most modern security concepts, the total security of a device is reduced to the largest flaw; in the case of the most well-known hardware wallets, it is not true, as advertised, that the private key never leaves the device, but leaves it at the moment in which it is written on a piece of paper, this makes events such as:
The cleaning lady finds the passphrase (the 24 words) in a piece of paper hidden between the pages of a book, so this is the security level of this hardware device!
This is the biggest flaw and this is therefore the maximum security level of your wallet.

## Trezor and Ledger bug fix

This project allows you to keep your passphrase in cold storage that cannot be hacked in any way:
We took our idea from the concept of security introduced by Bitcoin technology: Security does not have to be intrinsic in the hardware or in making things inaccessible, but it must be in the algorithm! In contrast to secure backup systems at the hardware level (systems based on trust in the hardware), we have developed a secure save system at the algorithm level (trustless), whose code is open source and inspectable.
What does this mean, if the passphrase saved with our software falls into the hands of hackers or malicious people, it cannot under any circumstances be deciphered, neither with attacks on the encryption algorithms, nor even with a brute force attack!

## Cold passphrase storage
We have created a stand alone version:
A cold storage based on a pen drive bootable system (isolated from the internet), this device will be marketed to finance the project.
We would like to point out that the security of the device is based on algorithms, and working cold is simply additional security:
Any physical or internet theft does not allow the passphrase to be restored!
